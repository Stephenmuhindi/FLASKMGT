# ONLINE PROPERTY MANAGER

## 🏠 Your Property's Best Ally

### 🌟 Inspiration

Imagine being a property owner in Kenya, struggling to find a reliable platform to list your rental properties. That was the spark behind ONLINE PROPERTY MANAGER. Frustrated by the lack of specialized platforms catering to the unique needs of property owners and short-term clients in Kenya, I envisioned a solution that would not only fill this gap but also ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.

### 🚀 The Challenge

The primary challenge was to create a user-friendly, accessible, and efficient platform that would serve as a bridge between property owners and potential clients. I set out to develop a platform that would accommodate a diverse user base, from individual landlords to property management companies, agents, and agencies.

### 🤔 Struggles & Learnings

**Accessibility:** Ensuring the platform was accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, was a significant challenge. I leaned heavily on WCAG guidelines and tools like WAVE, aXe, and Lighthouse for accessibility testing. Implementing features like semantic HTML, alternative text for images, and keyboard accessibility required meticulous attention to detail but was crucial for creating an inclusive platform.

**Technical Stack:** Choosing the right technologies for both frontend and backend development was another hurdle. I opted for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React for the frontend, RESTful API endpoints for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Implementing JWT for authentication and optimizing assets for performance were essential steps in ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 🛠️ Technical Details

#### **Accessibility Features**
- Semantic HTML for structured content
- Alternative text for images

#### **Frontend & Backend**

### 📈 Next Iteration

For the next iteration, I plan to focus on:
- **Enhanced Security:** Implementing additional security measures to protect user data and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
- **User Feedback:** Incorporating user feedback to improve features and functionalities.
- **Scalability:** Optimizing the platform for scalability to accommodate a growing user base.

### 📅 Timeline
